    <h1 id="secret_text1" class="AT">Hey! You found the secret page! Congrats!</h1>
    <h2 id="secret_text2" class="AN">This page is here because, at the time of coding (a lazy June Friday in 2022) I am extremely, extremely bored.</h2>
    <h4 id="secret_text3" class="AN">A bit of insight into the process of making this website. I borrowed a nice Mac laptop from school so I could finish up my website before it was due. However, I ended finishing a Lot earlier than I thought I would, so I just started going ham with all sorts of additions, everything from the spinning Johnny Snakearms to linking pages, hover elements, and a bunch of other fancy coding stuff. And, for the final piece of Extraneous Code, we have an entire webpage hidden in a very ineffective way where I ramble on and on. So, I'll go over some things that happened while coding, a few fun facts about me, and other whatever other misc. nonsense I decide to put here.</h4>

    <ol id="secret_list">
        <li>Coding this website was an absolute Pain. Few people can claim to have seen me have a mental breakdown over boxes, but my friends Gayatri, Vianca, Maddie, Erin, Maya, and Thomas most certainly can.</li>
        <li>This page has the least CSS coding of all of the pages. By quite a lot. At the type of typing, I have nearly 800 lines of CSS, and only about 10 of those are for this page.</li>
        <li>Speaking of which, this page's official name in the code is "owo.html"</li>
        <li>I have not turned in a single review sheet for Mr. Kafader's biology class this year. I am still passing his class, however.</li>
        <li>My all time favorite anime is Seven Deadly Sins. Despite that, I hate Meliodas with a burning hatred. On top of his more... unsavory character features, he's also just incredibly boring compared to the rest of the cast. Don't @ me.</li>
        <li>Once upon a time, I had a tumblr account. It was called "bow--to--no--one", it was mostly Destiny content, and has been inactive for a while now. Feel free to take a look though.</li>
        <li>Speaking of which, Destiny is one of my favorite games/franchises of all time. That being said, I haven't played the game in three years.</li>
        <li>Skyrim is also on the list of "Emma's Favorite Franchises". What? I'm a sucker for fantasy.</li>
        <li>I would like to thank the websites "css-tricks.com" and "w3schools.com" for making this entire process so much less of a headache than it could have been.</li>
        <li>I have a dndbeyond account with 24 characters. I have played exactly 1 of them. Her name is Curiosity, and she's a Tiefling Warlock.</li>
        <li>My digital design teacher will likely read this page and find it while he grades it. I should probably say hello. Hello Mr. Greider!</li>
        <li>Season 4 of Stranger Things has just come out, and I still haven't watched it yet. Instead, I continue to code a page that is literally useless. Why? Because I haven't taken my ADHD meds this morning.</li>
        <li>My largest writing project is a Skyrim fanfiction, "The Tale of the Dragonborn" that was on the writing page. At the time of writing, it is 135k words. For context, that's longer than "The Hobbit", almost as long as "The Return of the King", and longer than "A Tale of Two Cities", "Pride and Prejudice", "To Kill A Mockingbird", and "1984". </li>
        <li>That excerpt from "Tale of the Dragonborn" is actually edited. Because it contained many, many family-unfriendly words. Let's just say Tallu has something of a potty mouth.</li>
        <li>I'm continuing to add to this list so I can tell my dad that I'm coding for school and therefore, avoid leaving the house.</li>
        <li>It's about 1pm now. I should probably get some lunch.</li>
        <li>I've actually written a D&D one-shot, called Wilderthorne Tavern. I've run it twice, once that failed miserbly because two of the guys I was playing with were being drunk a-holes. The second time, thankfully, went better.</li>
        <li>If you've read all the way down here, good for you. Should I add a secret code? I love ARGs, and I wanna make something secret on a website for people to speculate about my works. I want a fandom, yknow?</li>
        <li>If I do add a secret code, expect it to be decently hidden. I watch Game Theory, I know my way around an ARG or two.</li>
        <li>Unfortunately, cultivating a fandom would require some luck, marketing, and a consistent writing schedule. I could probably manage, but I also have high school to deal with. Maybe in college?</li>
        <li>Okay, I'm done. I'm going to get some lunch, format this page, and then finally be done with this project.</li>
