<div id="about_me_main"> 
        <p class="AN" id="about_me_body">Hey there! Welcome to the "About Me" page, where I drop some of the professionalism from the home page so you can get a look at the woman who made the site you're viewing.</p>
        <p class="AN" id="about_me_body2">As previously mentioned, my name is Emma Pegram. But aside from coding, photography, digital design, and writing (all of which are presented on this website) there's a lot I enjoy. In particular, I love video games, Dungeons and Dragons, and marching band. Basically, a cocktail of interests that most would consider some degree of nerdy. Occasionally, I also write music, though in a very loose sort of format. My main passion, however, is writing. From short stories that never got finished to half-edited novellas to epic, high fantasy sagas, my experience with writing has taken me far and wide, exploring many different cultures, places, times, and even things about myself.</p>
        <p class="AN" id="about_me_body2">I hope this site gives you a bit more insight into who I am, and what I like to do. Shoot me an email or send a message to my discord if you'd like to chat. Or, if an employer of mine somehow finds this, take a peek at my resume. And again, thanks for stopping by :)</p>
